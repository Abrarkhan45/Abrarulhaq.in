            <h1>About Me</h1> <br> <br>
            <p>Hello, My name is Abrar Khan, and I work as a web designer and developer in the center of the digital universe. My area of expertise is developing stunning, useful websites that are memorable. I want to bring original ideas to life with a great passion for both design and coding.</p> <br> <br>
            <p>My quest started with an interest in the online world and a desire to learn. I've improved my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages throughout the years. I think that the internet has the ability to inspire, educate, and connect people, and I'm eager to take part in that process.</p> <br> <br>

                <p id="skill-p">Web development is the process of creating and maintaining 
                    websites and web applications that people access over the Internet.
                     This includes designing the user interface, writing code to make the site
                      interactive, and managing the back-end infrastructure that stores and processes
                       data. Web development includes both the visual aspects that users see and the
                        behind-the-scenes functions that drive a website's functionality.
                         It is a combination of technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side
                          languages, databases, and frameworks. From building simple static websites
                           to complex dynamic applications, web development 
                    plays a vital role in shaping the online experiences we encounter every day.</p>

            <p id="skill-p">Video editing is the art and process of manipulating
                 and arranging video clips to create cohesive and engaging
                  visual stories. This includes selecting and trimming clips, 
                  adding transitions, applying effects, and including audio to 
                  improve the overall quality and impact of your video. Video editing 
                  is critical to turning raw footage into a polished final product, whether 
                  it's a short film, documentary, marketing video or content for a social media
                   platform. Through the skilled use of editing software, professionals and amateurs 
                   alike can create videos
                 that captivate audiences, communicate information effectively, and evoke emotion.</p>
